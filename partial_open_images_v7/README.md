This is a dataset builder for the 7th version of the Open Images Dataset. At this point the builder only supports a part of the dataset, including image-level labels, bounding box labels and MAIP labels.

The builder currently relies on all images being downloaded into the tensorflow datasets manual_dir according to the instructions found here: https://github.com/cvdfoundation/open-images-dataset#download-full-dataset-with-google-storage-transfer. All train images should go into a folder named "train", validation images into a folder named "validation", and test images into a folder named "test".
